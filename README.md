First Version of Time Logger
-----
As this is the first version of the Time Logger it has limited functionality
* Users are only able to enter integers for hours worked (no decimals)
* The program is case sensitive for employee usernames and client usernames
(ex: you can enter employee_username and Employee_username and it will create
2 different users)
* spaces after your input will cause the input to be invalid
